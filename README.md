# bmad-swarm

Autonomous development teams powered by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) Agent Teams, built on the [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD).

BMAD Swarm combines BMAD's structured brainstorming and documentation with Claude Agent Teams' parallel execution. Run `bmad-swarm init` once to configure your project, then `bmad-swarm start` to launch. There are no special commands to learn, no agent names to remember, no workflow to manage -- the methodology activates automatically.

Unlike the original BMAD Method (which requires manually switching agent personas and running workflow commands), BMAD Swarm integrates directly into Claude Code. `bmad-swarm start` launches Claude with the orchestrator identity loaded via the `/identity-orchestrator` slash command -- so every message you send is automatically routed through the orchestrator methodology. It reads your request, assesses complexity, assembles the right team, and manages the full lifecycle. You just talk.

**Anyone can use it.** Non-technical users describe ideas in plain language and make design choices while the AI handles all code decisions. Technical users go as deep as they want -- debate architecture, review patterns, pick frameworks. The system reads your conversation style and adapts.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 18** -- [download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Claude Code** installed and authenticated -- [setup guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)
- A git-initialized project directory

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g bmad-swarm

# Create a project
mkdir my-app && cd my-app && git init

# Initialize the swarm
bmad-swarm init

# Launch Claude with orchestrator instructions
bmad-swarm start
> Build a task management API with user authentication
```

`bmad-swarm init` generates:
- `swarm.yaml` -- project configuration (you own and edit this)
- `.claude/agents/` -- agent definitions for each role
- `.claude/hooks/` -- quality gate hooks
- `.claude/settings.json` -- Claude Code permissions
- `.claude/commands/` -- slash commands (9 identity-* plus 8 workflow commands like `/bug`, `/feature`, `/research`)
- `.claude/rules/` -- methodology rules (coding standards, quality standards, orchestrator methodology)
- `CLAUDE.md` -- project context (type, stack, phases, artifacts)
- `artifacts/` -- directory structure for all methodology artifacts
- `project.yaml` -- project state tracking

## Plugins

This fork ships four BMAD-native Claude Code plugin packs under `plugins/` that close UX gaps specific to autonomous-mode workflows -- where the human is supervising a multi-agent run rather than driving each edit. They are local-first and bundled with the fork; none of them are published to a public Claude Code plugin marketplace, and none are required to use bmad-swarm. Install the ones you want, ignore the rest.

| Pack | Version | Purpose | Slash namespace | Install |
|------|---------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `bmad-tools` | 0.2.0 | Workflow utilities (validate, status, complexity, lessons, audit) | `/bmad-tools:*` | `/plugin install ./plugins/bmad-tools` |
| `bmad-ui` | 0.1.0 | UI/UX-specialized skills + reviewer agent | `/bmad-ui:*` | `/plugin install ./plugins/bmad-ui` |
| `bmad-console` | 0.2.0 | Real-time web dashboard (phases, decisions, sprint, network) | n/a -- run via Node | `node plugins/bmad-console/bin/start.cjs` |
| `bmad-statusline` | 0.1.0 | Claude Code statusline with BMAD-specific signals | n/a -- statusline | edit `.claude/settings.json` (see below) |

### bmad-tools

Seven skills and two hooks for the maintenance side of a BMAD project -- validating artifacts, checking decisions, scoring complexity before assembly, harvesting lessons from retrospectives, and migrating story formats.

Skills:

- `/bmad-tools:validate-artifact` -- run a single artifact through the matching quality gate
- `/bmad-tools:project-status` -- summarize the current phase, gates, agents, and pending approvals
- `/bmad-tools:score-complexity` -- score a request across the five complexity dimensions before team assembly
- `/bmad-tools:extract-lessons` -- harvest lessons-learned entries from reviews and retrospectives
- `/bmad-tools:audit-decisions` -- check that every D-ID is referenced through the artifact chain
- `/bmad-tools:schema-doctor` -- diagnose and repair drifted artifact frontmatter / schemas
- `/bmad-tools:migrate-stories` -- bulk-migrate story files between schema versions

```bash
/plugin install ./plugins/bmad-tools
```

### bmad-ui

UI/UX-specialized skills plus a dedicated reviewer identity. Use it on any phase that produces visual or interaction artifacts.

Skills:

- `/bmad-ui:design-tokens` -- author / lint a design-token set (color, type, space, motion)
- `/bmad-ui:scaffold-ui-story` -- generate a UI-flavored story with screen states and a11y acceptance criteria
- `/bmad-ui:component-spec` -- write a component spec (props, states, variants, a11y notes) for the developer
- `/bmad-ui:a11y-review` -- WCAG-focused review pass over an implemented component or page

Agent:

- `@bmad-ui:ux-reviewer` -- adversarial UX reviewer identity; pairs with the standard `reviewer` for visual / interaction work

```bash
/plugin install ./plugins/bmad-ui
```

### bmad-console

A real-time web dashboard for watching an autonomous BMAD run unfold. Editorial-meets-mission-control aesthetic -- paper default with an inverse mode, Source Serif 4 for prose, JetBrains Mono for IDs and code. The console reads `artifacts/` and `project.yaml` directly; no server-side state.

Views:

- **Dashboard** -- phase ribbon (Ideation -> Delivery), live agent roster, autonomy mode, pending approvals, "since you left" digest of what changed since your last visit
- **Decisions** -- decision cartouches for every D-ID with the full chain (brief -> PRD -> architecture -> story -> review)
- **Sprint** -- Gantt of the current sprint with dependency arrows between stories and gate markers
- **Network** -- decision network graph showing how D-IDs connect across artifacts
- **Replay** -- scrubber over the project's artifact history; rewind to any prior state of the run

Empty / brand-new projects fall through to a demo mode with seeded fixtures so the views are explorable before you have real artifacts.

```bash
node plugins/bmad-console/bin/start.cjs
# open http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

### bmad-statusline

A Claude Code statusline that surfaces BMAD-specific signals on every prompt. ~44ms cold spawn so it does not slow the prompt loop; honors `NO_COLOR`.

Output format:

```
my-project · design · auto · 1 pending · 4 agents · D-042
```

Fields, left to right: project name, current phase, autonomy mode, pending human approvals, active agent count, last decision ID.

Install by pointing your `.claude/settings.json` `statusLine` at the bundled binary:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node plugins/bmad-statusline/bin/statusline.cjs"
  }
}
```

### Why these and not generic plugins?

Most AI-tool UX plugins surface tool-shaped signals -- model name, working directory, token usage, file diffs. Those are useful, but they tell you nothing about whether your run is healthy on its own terms. These four packs surface BMAD-shaped signals instead: which phase you are in, which decisions have been made and where they flow, which agents are alive, which gates are pending, whether you are in `auto` / `guided` / `collaborative`. That is the layer BMAD makes first-class, and it is the layer the human supervising an autonomous run actually needs.

A longer treatment of the visual and interaction language used across the console and statusline lives in the design language doc generated locally during development at `artifacts/design/bmad-console-design-language.md` (gitignored, so it is not a stable upstream link).

## How It Works

BMAD Swarm works by generating configuration files that Claude Code reads automatically. The agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`, hooks in `.claude/hooks/`, and rules in `.claude/rules/` are all standard Claude Code features -- bmad-swarm just generates them with the right content.

The key is the **slash-command identity system**. On a fresh session the orchestrator invokes `/identity-orchestrator` as its first action; the command body is the full orchestrator role and arrives as user-turn content, which the model weights more heavily than system-ambient instructions. A `UserPromptSubmit` hook emits a short (<40 token) reminder on the first turn of a session pointing at `/identity-orchestrator` and the 8 workflow commands. After context compaction a `SessionStart` hook re-points the orchestrator at the same slash command. This is reinforced by `.claude/rules/` files that define agent routing and quality standards, and `CLAUDE.md` provides project context (stack, phases, artifact locations).

After initialization, launch with `bmad-swarm start` and just talk. No special commands, no agent names to remember.

### The Orchestrator

Claude itself becomes the orchestrator -- an AI coordinator that never writes code, only delegates. When you give it a task:

1. **Assesses complexity** across 5 dimensions (scope, clarity, technical risk, codebase size, dependencies)
2. **Selects the orchestration mode**:
   - **Interactive** -- Single agent works directly with you (brainstorming, planning, design decisions)
   - **Parallel** -- Multiple agents work simultaneously (implementation, review, QA)
   - **Hybrid** -- Interactive for planning phases, parallel for building
3. **Assembles the right team** -- only the agents needed, not the full roster
4. **Creates a task graph** with dependencies and quality gates
5. **Adapts to you** -- reads your conversation style and calibrates which decisions to involve you in vs. handle autonomously

### Phases

Planning phases default to interactive mode (one agent working with you). Building phases default to parallel mode (multiple agents working simultaneously).

| Phase | Mode | Purpose | Primary Agents |
|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| **0. Ideation** | Interactive | Brainstorm and refine ideas | Ideator |
| **1. Exploration** | Interactive | Research problem space | Researcher |
| **2. Definition** | Interactive | Define requirements (PRD) | Strategist |
| **3. Design** | Interactive | Architecture and technical decisions | Architect |
| **4. Implementation** | Parallel | Build, test, review in sprints | Developer, Reviewer, QA |
| **5. Delivery** | Parallel | Final validation and handoff | Reviewer, QA |

Phases are skipped based on complexity. A bug fix goes straight to Implementation. A small feature might skip Exploration and Definition.

### Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **orchestrator** | Team lead. Assesses complexity, builds teams, creates task graphs. Never implements directly. |
| **ideator** | Structured brainstorming partner. Uses 17 techniques, anti-bias protocols, and elicitation methods. Adapts to your thinking style. |
| **researcher** | Discovery, analysis, and context acquisition. Web research and codebase scanning. |
| **strategist** | Product strategy, requirements definition, PRD creation. |
| **architect** | Technical design, system architecture, technology selection. |
| **story-engineer** | Creates implementation-ready stories with BDD acceptance criteria. |
| **developer** | Story implementation following TDD. Multiple developers can work in parallel. |
| **reviewer** | Adversarial code review. Validates quality, security, architecture compliance, and decision traceability. |
| **qa** | Test strategy, automated test creation, coverage analysis. |
| **retrospective** | Post-epic analysis. Extracts patterns from reviews and updates lessons-learned. |
| **devops** | Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment automation. |
| **security** | Security design, threat modeling, vulnerability analysis. |
| **tech-writer** | Documentation, API docs, user guides. |

### Decision Traceability

Every significant decision gets a **D-ID** (Decision ID) that flows through the entire artifact chain:

```
Human says "mobile-first" during brainstorming
  -> D-001 logged in product brief
    -> Strategist references D-001 in PRD requirement
      -> Architect references D-001 in frontend design
        -> Story engineer includes D-001 in acceptance criteria
          -> Reviewer verifies D-001 compliance
```

Decisions made once are never silently dropped.

### Adaptive Interaction

The system reads your conversation style and adapts in real-time:

- **Technical language** ("Should we use connection pooling?") -- engages at technical depth
- **Design language** ("Make the sidebar collapsible") -- engages on UX
- **Business language** ("We need to beat competitor X on onboarding") -- engages on strategy

Agents auto-resolve decisions you wouldn't care about (library choices, folder structure) and escalate decisions you would (scope, business logic, architecture tradeoffs).

### Autonomy Levels

| Level | Behavior | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `auto` | No human checkpoints. Reports results at the end. | Bug fixes, small features, well-defined tasks |
| `guided` | Pauses at phase boundaries for human review. | Medium features, new modules |
| `collaborative` | Pauses at phase boundaries AND within phases for key choices. | New apps, major redesigns, vague requirements |

## CLI Reference

### `bmad-swarm init`

Initialize a new project in the current directory.

```bash
bmad-swarm init [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--scan` | Auto-detect language, framework, and test setup from existing codebase |
| `--template <name>` | Use a predefined stack template |
| `-y, --yes` | Accept all defaults without interactive prompts |
| `--github` | Generate GitHub Actions workflow for artifact validation (`.github/workflows/bmad-validate.yml`) |

**Available templates:**

| Template | Stack |
|----------|-------|
| `next-app` | TypeScript + Next.js + Jest |
| `express-api` | TypeScript + Express + Jest |
| `react-app` | TypeScript + React + Vitest |
| `node-cli` | JavaScript + node:test |
| `python-api` | Python + FastAPI + pytest |

### `bmad-swarm start`

Launch Claude Code in the project. Orchestrator identity loads via the `/identity-orchestrator` slash command on the first user turn (a `UserPromptSubmit` hook prompts the orchestrator to invoke it).

```bash
bmad-swarm start [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--print` | Print the claude command instead of running it |

Tool permissions are now scoped via `.claude/settings.json` (`allow` + `deny` lists + `defaultMode: acceptEdits`) rather than CLI flags. See ADR-001 for the permission model.

### `bmad-swarm update`

Regenerate all managed files from `swarm.yaml` including agents, CLAUDE.md, slash commands, hooks, rules, and settings. Safe to run repeatedly -- never touches user-owned files (`swarm.yaml`, `overrides/`, `artifacts/`, `src/`).

```bash
bmad-swarm update [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be regenerated without writing any files |
| `--force` | Overwrite files even if they have been manually modified |

### `bmad-swarm eject agent <name>`

Copy an agent template to `overrides/agents/` for local customization on a single project. The ejected copy takes priority over the package version and survives `bmad-swarm update`.

```bash
bmad-swarm eject agent developer
# Edit overrides/agents/developer.md to taste
bmad-swarm update  # your override is preserved
```

### `bmad-swarm uneject agent <name>`

Remove a local override and restore the package version.

### `bmad-swarm scan`

Detect stack from the current codebase and generate `project-context.md`.

### `bmad-swarm status`

Show project configuration, current phase, agent status, and artifact counts.

## Escape Hatches

Not every task needs the full lifecycle:

```bash
# Quick bug fix -- skips straight to implementation
> Fix: users can't log in with special characters in email

# Brainstorm only -- no code, just thinking
> I have a vague idea for a tech debt tracker. Help me think through it.

# Skip to coding with defaults
bmad-swarm init -y
bmad-swarm start
> Add a /health endpoint to the API
```

Disable phases in `swarm.yaml`:

```yaml
methodology:
  phases:
    exploration: { enabled: false }
    definition: { enabled: false }
```

## Per-Project Customization (Eject/Override)

Three layers for customizing agent behavior on a specific project:

1. **Package templates** (default) -- ship with `bmad-swarm`, regenerated on `bmad-swarm update`
2. **swarm.yaml overrides** (lightweight) -- add `extra_context` or `extra_rules` per agent
3. **Ejected overrides** (full control) -- `bmad-swarm eject agent <name>` copies the template for free editing

Resolution order: ejected file > package template + swarm.yaml overrides.

This is for customizing agent behavior within a single project (e.g., adding domain-specific rules to the architect). To change bmad-swarm itself, see [Development](#development) below.

## Wide-team specialization

Wide-team specialization lets you pre-spawn multiple domain-specialized teammates (e.g., one developer dedicated to `backend-auth`, another to `backend-upload`, another to `frontend-dashboard`) instead of recycling one generic developer across many domains. Each specialist holds bounded context for the entire session and only handles stories within its domain — addressing long-context drift without abandoning the long-running multi-story workflow. See `artifacts/design/architecture.md` for the full design and ADR-004 / ADR-006 in `artifacts/design/decisions/` for the schema and story-field details.

**Dynamic mode (default) is unchanged. Wide-team is opt-in.**

**Existing projects without this configuration are unaffected. No automatic migration runs on `bmad-swarm update`.**

### Retrofit procedure (existing projects)

To opt in to wide-team specialization for an existing project:

1. Ensure `artifacts/design/architecture.md` includes a Domain Map section. Run `/feature` or `/plan` and ask the architect to add it if missing.
2. Edit `swarm.yaml` to add a `team` block (`mode: fixed`, list specializations matching the domain map).
3. Optionally update existing story files to include a `## Domain:` field, matching one of the declared specialists.
4. On the next session, the orchestrator will use fixed-mode routing.

### Worked example: `team` block in `swarm.yaml`

```yaml
team:
  mode: fixed                    # dynamic (default) | fixed — opt in to wide-team
  specializations:               # only meaningful when mode: fixed
    - role: developer
      domain: backend-auth       # required when role is specialized; kebab-case slug
      description: >             # optional, free-text — passed into the spawn brief
        OAuth2/PKCE flow, session storage, password reset endpoints.
    - role: developer
      domain: backend-upload
      description: File ingestion pipeline, S3 adapters, virus-scan integration.
    - role: developer
      domain: frontend-dashboard
      description: React dashboard pages, charts, real-time websocket UI.
    - role: reviewer
      domain: backend-auth
      description: >
        Reviewer dedicated to auth/security stories. (Optional — reviewer
        continuity is the consistency anchor by default.)
  fallback:
    enabled: true                # default: true — generic dev for unrouted stories
    role: developer
```

Stories without a `## Domain:` field route to the generic-dev fallback. Stories whose domain doesn't match any declared specialist trigger the orchestrator's mid-epic injection decision tree (spawn a new specialist if ≥2 stories are anticipated in that domain, otherwise route to fallback). See the orchestrator role doc for routing rules.

### Retrofit tooling for existing projects

Two opt-in tools remove the manual edits when adopting wide-team in a project that already has an architecture: `/retrofit-team` (slash command) proposes the Domain Map and inserts it into `architecture.md`; `bmad-swarm scaffold-team` (CLI) reads that Domain Map and emits the matching `team:` block for `swarm.yaml`. Both are deliberate user actions — neither runs automatically. See `artifacts/design/architecture-retrofit.md` for the full design and ADR-010 / ADR-011 / ADR-012 for the design decisions (overlay-vs-spawn, write safety, parser contract).

**`/retrofit-team` (slash command).** Invoked inside a Claude Code session. The orchestrator loads the architect's Domain Map heuristics into its own session, reads the existing `artifacts/design/architecture.md`, and proposes a Domain Map iteratively with you. After explicit human approval (architecture is approval-gated per the project's CLAUDE.md invariant), it spawns one architect teammate whose only job is to insert the approved Domain Map verbatim into `architecture.md` — the architect spawn is a write-delegate, not a designer. Refuses cleanly if the project is already wide-team configured, if `architecture.md` is missing, or if a `## Domain Map` section already exists.

**`bmad-swarm scaffold-team` (CLI).** Reads the `## Domain Map` from `architecture.md` and emits the corresponding `team:` block. Default behavior is read-only — prints YAML to stdout so you can paste-and-edit. Pass `--write` to inject the block into `swarm.yaml`; `--write` first copies the existing file to `swarm.yaml.bak` (rolled, single backup), writes atomically, and round-trips the result through `loadSwarmConfig` to validate before declaring success. Refuses with an exit code and a unified diff if `swarm.yaml` already has a `team:` block — git history is the long-term archive.

**Worked example chain.**

```
$ # 1. In a Claude Code session:
> /retrofit-team
[orchestrator-overlay reads architecture.md; proposes Domain Map]
[user iterates with the orchestrator on the partition]
[user approves; orchestrator spawns architect; architect inserts the section]
> [exits overlay]

$ # 2. Preview the corresponding team: block:
$ bmad-swarm scaffold-team
team:
  mode: fixed
  specializations:
    - role: developer
      domain: backend-auth
      description: OAuth2/PKCE, sessions, password flows
    - role: developer
      domain: backend-upload
      description: File ingestion, S3, virus scan
    - role: developer
      domain: frontend-dashboard
      description: React dashboard pages
  fallback:
    enabled: true
    role: developer

$ # 3. Inject (after reviewing the preview):
$ bmad-swarm scaffold-team --write
Wrote 3 specializations to swarm.yaml
Backup: swarm.yaml.bak
Next: review the diff (git diff swarm.yaml), then run `bmad-swarm validate` and `bmad-swarm update`.

$ # 4. Confirm and regenerate:
$ bmad-swarm validate
$ bmad-swarm update
```

Each step is reversible: `architecture.md` edits live in git; `swarm.yaml.bak` lets you undo `--write` once; nothing under `.claude/` is touched until `bmad-swarm update` runs.

**No silent migration.** Neither `bmad-swarm init` nor `bmad-swarm update` invokes either retrofit tool. The user types the slash command, approves the proposed Domain Map, and runs the CLI explicitly — every edit is a deliberate action.

## Artifact System

Agents coordinate through structured files on disk, not message passing. Each agent reads only the artifacts relevant to its task.

```
artifacts/
  exploration/     Research and analysis
  planning/        Product brief, PRD
  design/          Architecture, ADRs
  implementation/  Epics, stories
  reviews/         Code reviews, retrospectives, test reports
  context/         Project context, decision log, lessons learned
```

### Key areas to modify

**Agents** (`agents/*.md`): Each agent is a Markdown file with Role, Expertise, Inputs, Outputs, Quality Criteria, and Behavioral Rules. Edit these to change how an agent thinks and works. Changes here affect all new projects on `bmad-swarm init` or `bmad-swarm update`.

**Methodology** (`methodology/`): Phase definitions, quality gates, artifact schemas, brainstorming techniques, and decision frameworks. This is the "brain" of the system -- how the orchestrator decides what to do.

**Generators** (`generators/`): JavaScript modules that produce the files `bmad-swarm init` creates. If you want to change what gets generated (e.g., add a new workflow slash command, adjust the hook pipeline, or change the CLAUDE.md format), modify these.

**CLI** (`cli/`): Command implementations. Each file corresponds to a CLI command (`init.js`, `update.js`, `eject.js`, etc.).

### Eject vs. Development

| I want to... | Do this |
|--------------|---------|
| Change an agent's behavior for **one project** | `bmad-swarm eject agent <name>` in the project |
| Change an agent's behavior for **all projects** | Edit `agents/<name>.md` in the bmad-swarm repo |
| Add a new agent | Create `agents/<name>.md`, add to generator, update CLAUDE.md template |
| Change methodology (phases, gates, techniques) | Edit files in `methodology/` |
| Change what `bmad-swarm init` generates | Edit files in `generators/` and `templates/` |
| Add a new CLI command | Add a file in `cli/`, register in `bin/bmad-swarm.js` |

### Testing Changes Locally

```bash
# Link your local copy globally
npm link

# Now 'bmad-swarm' points to your local checkout
cd /some/test-project
bmad-swarm init

# Unlink when done
npm unlink -g bmad-swarm
```

## Relationship to BMAD Method

BMAD Swarm is built on the [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) by Brian Madison.

| | Original BMAD | BMAD Swarm |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution** | One AI, sequential, you switch personas manually | Multiple AI agents working in parallel |
| **Orchestration** | You manage the process with commands | Claude becomes the orchestrator automatically via the `/identity-orchestrator` slash command after `bmad-swarm start` |
| **Integration** | Load persona files into your AI session | `bmad-swarm init` once, then `bmad-swarm start` to launch -- no prefixes, no commands |
| **Brainstorming** | Structured techniques with named personas | Same techniques, invisible to the user, adaptive to your style |
| **Documentation** | Rich artifacts as a byproduct of the process | Same, plus decision traceability (D-IDs) across all artifacts |

BMAD Swarm keeps what BMAD does best -- structured brainstorming, rich documentation, phased methodology, quality gates -- and adds what Claude Agent Teams do best -- parallel execution, autonomous orchestration, and adaptive interaction.

## Troubleshooting

**`bmad-swarm init` says "already has a swarm.yaml"**
Run `bmad-swarm update` instead, or delete `swarm.yaml` to start fresh.

**Agents are not being spawned**
Verify `.claude/settings.json` exists. Re-run `bmad-swarm update` to regenerate it.

**The orchestrator spawns too many agents**
Set `methodology.autonomy: auto` in `swarm.yaml` and give more specific instructions.

**Tests are not running / wrong test framework**
Set `stack.testing` explicitly in `swarm.yaml`.

**Agent behavior is wrong after update**
Check `overrides/agents/` for ejected files. Run `bmad-swarm uneject agent <name>` to restore defaults.

**Quality gates blocking progress**
Check `artifacts/reviews/` for feedback. To relax gates: `methodology.quality.require_review: false` in `swarm.yaml`.

**The orchestrator ignores instructions or uses wrong agent types**
Make sure you launched with `bmad-swarm start` (not bare `claude`) and that the orchestrator invoked `/identity-orchestrator` as its first action. On a fresh session the `UserPromptSubmit` hook reminder points at this command; if it is missing, run `bmad-swarm update --force` to regenerate `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/hooks/`.

description: Brainstorm with ideator overlay (Mode A — orchestrator process step)
---

Enter brainstorm mode (orchestrator-overlay pattern). Do NOT emit a bmad-assembly block. Do NOT call TeamCreate. Brainstorming is a conversational orchestrator process step — teammates cannot converse with the human directly, so the ideator persona overlays onto your own session instead.

1. Read `agents/ideator.md` in full. Internalize the Four Lenses, brainstorming techniques, elicitation methods, and adaptive interaction rules.
2. Greet the user as a thinking partner. Ask what they want to explore.
3. Run the conversation directly. Apply lenses and techniques invisibly — do not announce them.
4. Track decisions internally as they emerge. Append D-IDs to `artifacts/context/decision-log.md` (tactical = one-line, strategic = full record).
5. **Check the exit condition at every turn.** Before your turn ends, ask: has the user signaled readiness to build ("let's do this", "ok, build it", "hand it off")? If yes, exit now — do not take another brainstorming turn.
6. On exit:
   - Write `artifacts/planning/brainstorm-<topic-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` containing: topic, key decisions with D-IDs, open questions, recommended next step.
   - Emit a `bmad-assembly` block for the recommended next phase (typically strategist for product brief + architect if architecture questions surfaced).
7. If the conversation reveals the idea needs substantial external research before it can be shaped further, suggest the user run `/explore-idea` (Mode B — ideator overlay + researcher in parallel). Do NOT silently spawn a researcher yourself mid-brainstorm.
